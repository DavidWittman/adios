  # Facts persist across plays, and these facts will be used in the
  # final step to make an API call to open all of the necessary ports in
  # the Google Compute Engine network firewall. This is necessary because Tor chooses
  # random ports for the obfsproxy pluggable transport and therefore they cannot be
  # opened in advance before Tor is up and running.
